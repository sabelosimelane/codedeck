## [2026-04-11] - Terminal Resilience Hardening

### Executive Summary
* Implemented a full terminal resilience layer for CodeDeck across six phases. Terminals now have a pane-local debug inspector with health classification, explicit recovery actions (Reconnect, Resync, Redraw), visibility-aware refocus recovery, a heartbeat/sequence-tracked transport with bounded replay, and optional durable sessions via tmux. The backend grew from 23 to 90 unit tests. These changes address the core pain of misbehaving panes that silently stall when a browser tab is backgrounded or a WebSocket reconnects.

### Technical Details
* **✨ New Feature:**
  * `server/terminal-runtime.js` — New runtime abstraction factory; supports raw node-pty (default) and tmux-backed sessions. Both expose `spawn`, `kill`, and `isSessionRecoverable`. Uses `execFileSync` for shell-injection safety in tmux commands.
  * `client/src/components/TerminalInspector.jsx` — New modal debug inspector panel; polls `/api/debug/terminal-health` every 3s, renders health dot + label, state snapshot table, reverse-chronological event timeline, Copy Snapshot action, and Recovery Actions (Reconnect / Resync / Redraw).
* **🛠️ Codebase:**
  * `server/ws-handler.js` — Session entries extended with `wsAttached`, `lastAttachAt`, `lastDetachAt`, `lastClientAckAt`, `lastReplayAt`, `lastSeq`, `stallReason`, `events[]`, `replayBuffer`, `runtimeType`. Added `pushTimelineEvent`, `computeSessionHealth`, `computeStallReason` exports. Handles `heartbeat`, `resume`, `replay`, `visibility_change`, and `recovery_action` WebSocket messages. Monotonic `seq` assigned to each output chunk and stored in a bounded 1000-entry replay buffer. Tmux-aware PTY exit handler with capped re-attach logic.
  * `server/index.js` — `GET /api/sessions` extended with health summary fields. `GET /api/debug/terminal-health` added with per-session diagnostics and last 20 timeline events. Runtime resolved from `CODEDECK_TERMINAL_RUNTIME` env var → SQLite config → `'pty'` default. Health endpoint returns active `terminalRuntime` type.
  * `client/src/components/Terminal.jsx` — Added `lastSeenSeqRef`, `reconnectCountRef`, `resumeInFlightRef`, `heartbeatRef`, and browser-view diagnostic refs. `document.visibilitychange` listener triggers refit + resize sync + replay request on refocus. Heartbeat sends client diagnostics every 5s. `useImperativeHandle` extended with `reconnect()`, `resync()`, `redraw()` recovery methods.
  * `client/src/components/TerminalArea.jsx` — Added Bug icon button per pane to trigger the inspector; renders `TerminalInspector` with session lookup and `onAction` dispatch across tabs/panes.
  * `start.sh` — Optional `CODEDECK_CAFFEINATE=1` wraps startup under macOS `caffeinate -i` to prevent idle sleep.
* **🧪 Tests:**
  * `server/__tests__/ws-handler.test.js` — Expanded from 23 to 90 tests. Added coverage for diagnostic metadata, health classification, stall detection (3 tiers), visibility change handling, seq assignment, replay buffer bounds, resume/replay correctness (exact, overflow, empty, caught-up), recovery action handling, tmux-aware exit and reconnect, and runtimeType storage.
* **📝 Docs:**
  * `README.md` — Added Terminal Resilience section documenting inspector, recovery actions, replay buffer, tmux mode, and caffeinate.
  * `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/steering/product.md`, `docs/steering/structure.md` — Updated to reflect new components, backend patterns, message types, and test count.
  * `docs/specifications/terminal-resilience-hardening-spec.md` — Status updated from Draft to Implemented.
  * `docs/todos/terminal-resilience-hardening.md` — All 34 tasks marked complete across 6 phases with full session notes.
  * `client/dist/index.html` — Rebuilt client bundle.
