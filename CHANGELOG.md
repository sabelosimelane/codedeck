## [2026-04-13] - Browser Notifications and Terminal Resilience Enhancements

### Executive Summary
* This update introduces browser notifications for long-running terminal tasks, allowing you to get an alert (with sound) when a command finishes while you're in another tab. It also adds several under-the-hood improvements to terminal autoscroll behavior, automatic cleanup of abandoned terminal sessions, and a new configuration setting to customize notification timing.

### Technical Details
* **✨ New Feature:**
  * `client/public/notification-sw.js` — Service worker to handle background notification clicks and focus.
  * `client/src/utils/browserNotifications.js` — Utilities for managing notification permissions, showing notifications via Service Worker, and playing completion audio cues.
  * `client/src/components/SettingsPanel.jsx` — Added `terminalFinishCooldownSeconds` setting to control how long a task must run before it triggers a notification.
* **🛠️ Codebase:**
  * `client/src/utils/terminalActivity.js` — Implemented notification payload generation logic and project-aware session detection.
  * `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` — Integrated browser notification orchestration, permission request flows, and audio "warming" on user interaction.
  * `client/src/utils/terminalAutoScroll.js` — Added helpers to detect viewport position and pause autoscroll on scroll-up.
  * `server/session-gc.js` — Implemented GC logic for pruning dead or long-detached terminal sessions to prevent memory leaks.
  * `client/src/main.jsx` — Added Service Worker registration.
* **🧪 Tests:**
  * `client/src/utils/__tests__/browserNotifications.test.js` — Unit tests for notification permission and display logic.
  * `client/src/utils/__tests__/terminalActivity.test.js` — Updated tests for new completion notification logic.
  * `client/src/utils/__tests__/terminalAutoScroll.test.js` — Tests for autoscroll viewport detection.
  * `server/__tests__/session-gc.test.js` — Integration tests for terminal session garbage collection.

## [2026-04-11] - Right-Click Context Menu for Copy Path in File Trees

### Executive Summary
* Right-clicking any file or directory in the sidebar file tree or the file browser panel now shows a context menu with "Copy relative path" and "Copy path" options. This makes it easy to grab a file's path for use in terminals, scripts, or other tools without manually constructing it. Also includes terminal focus reliability improvements and WebSocket URL construction cleanup.

### Technical Details
* **✨ New Feature:**
  * `client/src/components/FileContextMenu.jsx` — new shared context menu component with "Copy relative path" (relative to project root) and "Copy path" (absolute) options, toast confirmation, dismiss on click-outside or Escape
  * `client/src/components/FileTree.jsx` — added right-click handler to file and directory rows, renders FileContextMenu with project root for relative path calculation
  * `client/src/components/FileBrowserPanel.jsx` — same context menu integration for the modal file browser panel
* **🛠️ Codebase:**
  * `client/src/components/Terminal.jsx` — extracted WebSocket URL construction to `terminalWsUrl.js` utility, moved focus handling outside try/catch in `syncTerminalViewport()` so focus isn't blocked by fit() errors, added direct focus fallback on mouseDown
  * `client/src/utils/terminalWsUrl.js` — new utility for building terminal WebSocket URLs with proper protocol detection (ws/wss)
  * `client/src/components/__tests__/terminalWsUrl.test.js` — unit tests for WebSocket URL builder
  * `.gitignore` — added `playwright-*` pattern to ignore playwright artifacts

## [2026-04-11] - Fix Sidebar Activity Dot Stuck Green Due to Tmux Status Noise

### Executive Summary
* The sidebar's green activity dot for each terminal stayed permanently lit even when no real work was happening. The root cause was tmux's default status bar refreshing every 15 seconds, which generated PTY output that reset the activity timer. This fix suppresses the tmux status bar in CodeDeck-managed sessions and introduces a separate `lastSubstantialOutputAt` timestamp that only updates on meaningful terminal output (content containing newlines), so the sidebar correctly shows idle status when terminals are inactive.

### Technical Details
* **Bug Fix:**
  * Problem: tmux's `status-interval` (default 15s) sends periodic ANSI escape sequences through the PTY, updating `lastOutputAt` continuously. The sidebar checks this timestamp against a 45-second activity window, so the terminal never appeared idle.
  * Solution (two-pronged):
    * `server/terminal-runtime.js` — added `set-option status off` when creating new tmux sessions, eliminating the periodic noise at the source.
    * `server/ws-handler.js` — added `isSubstantialOutput()` heuristic (strips ANSI, checks for newlines) and `lastSubstantialOutputAt` field that only updates on real command output.
    * `server/index.js` — exposed `lastSubstantialOutputAt` in the `GET /api/sessions` response.
    * `client/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` — switched `getTerminalStatus()` and `getProjectStatus()` to use `lastSubstantialOutputAt` for activity classification.
* **Codebase:**
  * `client/src/components/Terminal.jsx` — refactored viewport sync into a unified `syncTerminalViewport()` helper, added output buffering for hidden panes via `bufferOrWriteChunk()`/`flushPendingOutput()`, added input buffering during WebSocket reconnection, replaced reconnection banner with a centered overlay spinner.
  * `client/src/components/TerminalArea.jsx` — `disconnectPane()` now sends `DELETE /api/terminal/:sessionId` to kill the PTY, `reconnectPane()` extracted as a separate action.
  * `client/src/utils/terminalLayoutState.js` — reworked `filterLayoutByLiveSessions()` to preserve split-pane widths when all panes are still live, merge missing live sessions into new tabs, and preserve intentionally disconnected panes.
  * `client/src/utils/terminalVisibility.js` — added `shouldWriteTerminalViewport()` guard for suppressing writes to hidden panes.
  * `client/src/styles/global.css` — added `.reconnect-spinner` animation for the new reconnect overlay.
* **Tests:**
  * `server/__tests__/ws-handler.test.js` — 4 new tests covering `lastSubstantialOutputAt` initialization, ANSI-only output filtering, newline-bearing output tracking, and `lastOutputAt` preservation for diagnostics.
  * `client/src/components/__tests__/TerminalArea.test.js` — 4 new tests for layout reconciliation: live session merging, split-pane width preservation, width renormalization on pane loss, and disconnected pane preservation.
  * `client/src/components/__tests__/terminalVisibility.test.js` — 3 new tests for `shouldWriteTerminalViewport()`.

## [2026-04-11] - Durable Tmux Defaults and Terminal View Recovery

### Executive Summary
* Hardened CodeDeck’s terminal behavior for long-running work by making durable `tmux` sessions the default runtime and fixing two recovery regressions that could leave a pane looking blank or stale after reconnecting or switching tabs. This reduces the chance that active builds or noisy log streams appear to vanish when the terminal process is still alive.

### Technical Details
* **🐛 Bug Fix:**
  * Problem: reattaching to an existing session could inject a literal `^L` into the live process and fail to request replay after a pane remounted.
  * Solution:
    * `server/ws-handler.js` — stopped sending `Ctrl+L` into the PTY on reconnect and kept the session handshake focused on replay-aware recovery.
    * `client/src/components/Terminal.jsx` — now requests replay when the server reports an `existing` session, centralizes resume requests, and refreshes the xterm viewport when a tab becomes visible again.
    * `client/src/utils/terminalResume.js` — extracted replay-handshake decision logic for a focused regression point.
    * `client/src/utils/terminalVisibility.js` — extracted visibility and size guards so hidden tabs do not send invalid resize/fitting updates.
* **🛠️ Codebase:**
  * `server/index.js` — changed terminal runtime resolution to default to `tmux` instead of raw PTY when no override is configured.
  * `server/terminal-runtime.js` — updated the runtime factory default and inline documentation to reflect `tmux` as the preferred durable backend.
  * `docs/steering/product.md` — updated the product-level description to treat durable sessions as the normal runtime behavior.
  * `docs/todos/terminal-resilience-hardening.md` — corrected implementation notes so the recorded default runtime matches the current behavior.
  * `README.md` — documented `tmux` as the default runtime, explicit override commands, and the relationship between durable sessions and the bounded replay buffer.
* **🧪 Tests:**
  * `server/__tests__/ws-handler.test.js` — added coverage proving reconnect no longer writes `Ctrl+L` into the PTY.
  * `client/src/components/__tests__/terminalResume.test.js` — added regression coverage for replay requests on existing-session handshakes.
  * `client/src/components/__tests__/terminalVisibility.test.js` — added regression coverage for suppressing resize/reflow work while a terminal tab is hidden.

## [2026-04-11] - Terminal Resilience Hardening

### Executive Summary
* Implemented a full terminal resilience layer for CodeDeck across six phases. Terminals now have a pane-local debug inspector with health classification, explicit recovery actions (Reconnect, Resync, Redraw), visibility-aware refocus recovery, a heartbeat/sequence-tracked transport with bounded replay, and optional durable sessions via tmux. The backend grew from 23 to 90 unit tests. These changes address the core pain of misbehaving panes that silently stall when a browser tab is backgrounded or a WebSocket reconnects.

### Technical Details
* **✨ New Feature:**
  * `server/terminal-runtime.js` — New runtime abstraction factory; supports raw node-pty (default) and tmux-backed sessions. Both expose `spawn`, `kill`, and `isSessionRecoverable`. Uses `execFileSync` for shell-injection safety in tmux commands.
  * `client/src/components/TerminalInspector.jsx` — New modal debug inspector panel; polls `/api/debug/terminal-health` every 3s, renders health dot + label, state snapshot table, reverse-chronological event timeline, Copy Snapshot action, and Recovery Actions (Reconnect / Resync / Redraw).
* **🛠️ Codebase:**
  * `server/ws-handler.js` — Session entries extended with `wsAttached`, `lastAttachAt`, `lastDetachAt`, `lastClientAckAt`, `lastReplayAt`, `lastSeq`, `stallReason`, `events[]`, `replayBuffer`, `runtimeType`. Added `pushTimelineEvent`, `computeSessionHealth`, `computeStallReason` exports. Handles `heartbeat`, `resume`, `replay`, `visibility_change`, and `recovery_action` WebSocket messages. Monotonic `seq` assigned to each output chunk and stored in a bounded 1000-entry replay buffer. Tmux-aware PTY exit handler with capped re-attach logic.
  * `server/index.js` — `GET /api/sessions` extended with health summary fields. `GET /api/debug/terminal-health` added with per-session diagnostics and last 20 timeline events. Runtime resolved from `CODEDECK_TERMINAL_RUNTIME` env var → SQLite config → `'pty'` default. Health endpoint returns active `terminalRuntime` type.
  * `client/src/components/Terminal.jsx` — Added `lastSeenSeqRef`, `reconnectCountRef`, `resumeInFlightRef`, `heartbeatRef`, and browser-view diagnostic refs. `document.visibilitychange` listener triggers refit + resize sync + replay request on refocus. Heartbeat sends client diagnostics every 5s. `useImperativeHandle` extended with `reconnect()`, `resync()`, `redraw()` recovery methods.
  * `client/src/components/TerminalArea.jsx` — Added Bug icon button per pane to trigger the inspector; renders `TerminalInspector` with session lookup and `onAction` dispatch across tabs/panes.
  * `start.sh` — Optional `CODEDECK_CAFFEINATE=1` wraps startup under macOS `caffeinate -i` to prevent idle sleep.
* **🧪 Tests:**
  * `server/__tests__/ws-handler.test.js` — Expanded from 23 to 90 tests. Added coverage for diagnostic metadata, health classification, stall detection (3 tiers), visibility change handling, seq assignment, replay buffer bounds, resume/replay correctness (exact, overflow, empty, caught-up), recovery action handling, tmux-aware exit and reconnect, and runtimeType storage.
* **📝 Docs:**
  * `README.md` — Added Terminal Resilience section documenting inspector, recovery actions, replay buffer, tmux mode, and caffeinate.
  * `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/steering/product.md`, `docs/steering/structure.md` — Updated to reflect new components, backend patterns, message types, and test count.
  * `docs/specifications/terminal-resilience-hardening-spec.md` — Status updated from Draft to Implemented.
  * `docs/todos/terminal-resilience-hardening.md` — All 34 tasks marked complete across 6 phases with full session notes.
  * `client/dist/index.html` — Rebuilt client bundle.
